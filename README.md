# image-encryption-tool
An image encryption tool uses pixel manipulation to secure visual data by changing the pixels so that the image cannot be read without the correct decryption key. Here’s a basic breakdown:

How it Works
- Pixel Modification: Each pixel’s color values (Red, Green, Blue) are changed using mathematical transformations like shifting, scrambling, or XOR operations.
- Key-Based Encryption: A secret key decides how the pixels are transformed. Without the key, the image looks like noise or distortion.
- Decryption: To restore the image, the encryption process is reversed using the same key, returning the pixels to their original state.

Common Techniques
- Pixel Shuffling: Rearranges pixels in a set pattern.
- Color Channel Manipulation: Changes the RGB values in a systematic way.
- Bit-Level Encryption: Encrypts pixel data at the binary level.
